I have done competitive programming, software development, and also networking, however, I am much more passionate about machine learning, and more specifically deep learning :brain: . My projects mainly involve Artifical Neural Networks (ANN) but I have also done work with Convolutional neural nets, genetic algorithms, and also language processing ðŸ—£ .
